    "We can answer this question by averaging the affordability over the 17 year time span (1999-2016) for each row in the graph. Then we could compare this to the population ranking by removing all other columns. We can then combine the repeated data from the same city multiple times by averaging the repeated terms. Once there are only two columns, average affordability and rank, we can order the data by population rank and then plot the data in a graph to see if there are any trends.\n",

Once there are only two columns, average affordability and Region Name, we can order the terms by lowest to hishest affordability.

Find the average for each quarter by finding the average for each column using all rows. There should now be only two rows, the date of data collecton and the average affordability. We can then plot a graph showing the average affordability over time, and see if there are any trends."

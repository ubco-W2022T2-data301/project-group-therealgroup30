# Group 30 - Mortgage Affordabilty Analysis

*"Helping future home buyers one cell at a time"*

## The dataset

Our dataset is on mortgage affortability in the US with data from 1999-2016. The dataset was found on data.world and data is from Zillow. The dataset shows the percentage of income spent on a mortgage, data is organized quarterly and is calcualted as a part of Zillowâ€™s quarterly Affordability Indices. To calculate mortgage affordability, Zillow calculates the mortgage payment for the median-valued home in a metropolitan area by using the metro-level Zillow Home Value Index for a given quarter and the 30-year fixed mortgage interest rate during that time period based on a 20 percent down payment. Then they consider what portion of the monthly median household income (U.S. Census) goes toward this monthly mortgage payment. Data is organized by metropolitan area and considers bottom, middle, and top tier homes/incomes. Zillow is a tech real-estate marketplace so the reason for data collection is quite trivial, they collect and analyze real estate data to provide valuable insights to home buyers and sellers. Data was collected by means of Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey for mortage rates and the US Census for average monthly income. 

## Introduction

A common interest theme that appeared when discussing this dataset among team members is that it is relatively actual to our generation. Skyrocketing home prices since Covid as well as never-ending interest rate spikes have driven home affordability incredibly low. This mortage affordability dataset covers the US up to 2017 and contains relevant information as first-time home buyers in Canada are facing an unprecedented real estate market. Additionally, the large scale of this dataset offers a lot of research angles, leaving a lot of flexibility for our group to conduct a data science project. 

Throughout this data analysis project we wil discuss a variety of factors which affect and/or relate to mortgage affordability as well as our findings. Such findings stem from the influence of population size, state or region and/or its location, the difference between different class levels of US citizens and the result of time.
